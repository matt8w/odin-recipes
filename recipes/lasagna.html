 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>ground beef</li>
    <li>bechamel sauce</li>
    <li>tomato passata</li>
    <li>carrot</li>
    <li>stalk</li>
    <li>onion</li>
    <li>white whine</li>
    <li>whole milk</li>
    <li>meat broth</li>
    <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>fine salt</li>
    <li>black pepper</li> 
</ul>    

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First cut the carrot, celery and onion in very tiny pieces.</li> 
    <li>Add the extra virgin olive oil and the finely chopped vegetables. Stir and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring. Then add the ground beef.</li>
    <li>Stir and cook for 5 minutes over medium / high heat. Now put the heat on high and add the white wine. Stir and let it evaporate.</li>
    <li> Finally add the tomato passata. Cover with a lid and simmer over LOW heat for about 2 hours. If the sauce dries too much during cooking, add a little meat broth. Towards the end, add the milk to dampen the acidity of the tomato. Season with salt and pepper. Bolognese Sauce is ready when you can see an oily, creamy sauce on the surface.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven at 190° (380 F). Spread on the bottom of a baking dish (better ceramic or pirex) two tablespoons of bechamel. Then put a lasagna noodle over it, trying to cover the entire bottom of the pan. If one lasagna is not enough for you, use another one, whole or in half, depending on the size of the lasagna. Layer on two tablespoons of bolognese sauce and two of bechamel sauce.</li>
    <li>With the help of a tablespoon, cover the entire surface of the lasagna. In the end, sprinkle two tablespoons of grated Parmigiano.</li>
    <li> Repeat these steps for at least five layers (lasagna – bolognese sauce – bèchamel – parmigiano), in any case up to fill your baking dish.</li>
